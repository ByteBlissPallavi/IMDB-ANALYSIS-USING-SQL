# IMDB-ANALYSIS-USING-SQL
In this project, I analysed the movie dataset using SQL queries and extracted valuable insights to guide Bolly Movies in planning their new project. The analysis will cover topics such as table exploration, movie release trends, production statistics, genre popularity, rating analysis, crew members, and more. 

Some of the critical areas of the Analysis using MYSQL include: 

• Movie Release Trends: Determining the total number of movies released each year and analyzing the month-wise trend using “YEAR” and “MONTH” functions with other clauses to extract. 

• Production Statistics and Genre Analysis: Identifying the genre with the highest number of movies produced. Determining the count of movies that belong to only one genre. Calculating the average duration of movies in each genre utilizing “DISTINCT”, “JOINS”, and “LIMIT” functions. 

• Rating Analysis and Crew Members: Identifying the top 10 movies based on average rating. Summarizing the rating table based on movie counts by median ratings. Identifying the production house that has produced the most number of hit movies by applying “MIN()” and” MAX()” functions along with other clauses. 

• Crew Analysis: Determining the top three directors in the top three genres of movies. Identifying the top three production houses based on the number of votes received by their movies. Ranking actors based on their average ratings in Indian movies released in India. Identifying the top five actresses in Hindi movies released in India based on their average ratings by “MULTIPLE JOINS” on a table and using “GROUP BY” and “ORDER BY” clauses. 

• Broader Understanding of Data: Classifying different genre movies based on average ratings into different categories and identifying the five highest grossing movies of each year that belong to the top three genres. Determining the top two production houses that have produced the highest hits among multilingual movies. Retrieving details for the top nine directors based on the number of movies, including average inter-movie duration, ratings, and more. Here I used multiple factors such as “CASE-WHEN” statements and “WINDOW FUNCTIONS” to calculate the Running total and moving average and used the “WITH” clause to refactor SUBQUERY.
